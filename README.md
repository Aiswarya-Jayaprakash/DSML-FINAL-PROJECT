Introduction:

Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSIs) are serious infections that occur when germs enter the bloodstream through a central line (central venous catheter. A central line is a catheter (tube) that healthcare providers often place in a large vein in the neck, chest or groin to give medication or fluids or to collect blood for medical tests. Central lines are different from peripheral IVs (shorter IVs placed in the hand, arm or foot for vein access); central lines access a major vein close to the heart, can remain in place for weeks or months, and are much more likely to be a source of serious infection. Central lines are commonly used in intensive care units. CLABSIs result in thousands of deaths each year and billions of dollars in added costs however they are preventable. These infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitals.

Problem: The goal of this project is to identify the key risk factors contributing to CLABSIs using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient and clinical data, we aim to predict the occurrence of positive gram-positive infections.

Importance: This analysis can help improve hospital practices, reduce CLABSI rates, and enhance patient outcomes.

Goal of the project: To build a machine learning model that identifies the primary risk factors of CLABSIs and predicts the likelihood of gram-positive infections.
